      <description>In the blog post &amp;ldquo;1948-1958 first 3 sets difference&amp;rdquo;, it explains how to distinguish the 3 sets of banknotes, but also explains that the obverse of the second and third sets of banknotes is the same. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell them apart from the front. I also paid a lot of tuition fees for this reason, because the value of the second set of banknotes is much higher than that of the third set of banknotes.</description>

      <description>Front Back          Many people discuss on the Internet that the 1952 8Pe coin is the rarest after Burma&amp;rsquo;s independence, calling it &amp;ldquo;the king of Burma coins&amp;rdquo;. So who is &amp;ldquo;the king of Burma paper money&amp;rdquo;? If I had to choose, I would choose the second set 5 rupee notes&amp;mdash;P.39. It is the least top 3 in the prefix number, and it is also the least in the number of notes found on the Internet.</description>
