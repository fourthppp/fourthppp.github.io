      <description>Burmese hare coins are made of lead and have two denominations, ¼ copper and ⅛ copper. Since copper coin is ¼ Pe, the face value of Hare coin is ¼ x ¼ , which is 1/16 Pe, and ⅛ x ¼, which is 1/32 Pe. The years are 1230 and 1231 Burmese calendar. But how many of them are there? Which one is rarer? I checked the database myself, and I recorded about 60 hare coins, of which 47 can be guessed their year, only 3 are in 1230, and the others are all 1231.</description>
