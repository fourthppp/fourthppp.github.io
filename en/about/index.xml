      <description>After the millennium, I began to collect precious metals. After a period of time, I was involved in Chinese gold and silver coins, coins of the Republic of China, stamps of the Cultural Revolution, Macau coins and Burma coins. After that, I made further research on the collection of Burma and began to collect Burma stamps, tax stamps, stocks, silverware and paintings. I habitually collect information on Burma collections on the internet every day, especially on eBay.</description>
