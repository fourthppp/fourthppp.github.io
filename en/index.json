    "content": "After the millennium, I began to collect precious metals. After a period of time, I was involved in Chinese gold and silver coins, coins of the Republic of China, stamps of the Cultural Revolution, Macau coins and Burma coins. After that, I made further research on the collection of Burma and began to collect Burma stamps, tax stamps, stocks, silverware and paintings. I habitually collect information on Burma collections on the internet every day, especially on eBay. I spend at least ten minutes a day, sometimes more than ten hours, for research and sorting. On the other hand, I also pay attention to the auctions of major auction houses; After 20 years of uninterrupted efforts, the self-made Burma database has more than 7,000 in banknotes, more than 2,000 in coins, more than 13,000 banknote photos, and more than 2,000 coin photos.\nSince 2008, I have been operating an online store, making my own website and starting to buy and sell on eBay. I have dealt with previously messy collections and only focused on Burma. After more than ten years of experience, my credit value on eBay is more than 300.\nAfter 2018, physical health sounded an alarm, reducing the intensity of online data collection, and trading has been suspended in 2020. At 2022, I know it may be time to give up. As long as I still have the ability and memory, I redesigned the website and added blog posts to record my subjective views on Burma over the years. Let’s kill time with myself.\nI once wanted to write a book about Burma’s collections. After reading The coins and banknotes of Burma by predecessors M. Robinson and L.A. Shaw repeatedly, the research and production are extremely rigorous, especially in coins. I have no official information, and my understanding of the Burmese language is superficial, making it difficult to write a book. The only thing that is useful in me is the statistics. So the blog posts are based on this aspect, and expresses the real facts of Burma’s collections from the other side.\nComputer failures occurred in 2013 and 2017, and hard drives were damaged. Some data were lost after repairments, but fortunately most of them were retained. Readers in the blog posts should not be too serious, but with a leisurely way.\n",

The problem occurred with the S88 serial number. In 2014, I found that the serial number of the P.1b banknote was greater than the S88 200000. I raised a question on this issue in Razack’s blog post. Razack’s answer at that time was based on the Nasik file. I revise the post at later time, my message has missed, and the serial number of P.1b in the blog post has also been changed to S88 200001 to S88 1000000, S89 and S90. However, when I wrote this article, I found that the serial number of some P.1b banknotes in my database was smaller than S88 200001. That is to say, there are P.1b with serial numbers larger and smaller than S88 200000 on the Internet. It seems that the serial number of P.1b needs to be further studied. It is safer to list its serial number as S88-90 for the time being.\nMany counterfeit banknotes of P.1 are fake overprinted on the real Indian P.15b, and it is easy to find out as long as you pay attention to the serial number. The same is true for P.2, adding a fake overprint on the real Indian P.16b.\nPrecautions:\n In the book “The Coins and Banknotes of Burma”, the author mentioned witness the essay of 1000 and 10000 rupees. Whether the 10,000 rupee has notes in circulation is still to be studied. In the article of ‘Indian Paper Money\", it is mentioned that the 100 rupees black overprint has serial number of T41, which is not found in my database for the time of this writing.    6 of them are only ¼ banknotes ↩︎\n   ",

Now, the weight of the Km25b tin lion coin is similar to that of the general Km25 copper lion coin, mainly because the coin body is thicker (which is also fit in my observations).\nPrecautions:\n Generally tin coins are difficult to store, and very few can clearly distinguish the pattern. Copper or tin coins are not one hundred percent made of the same material, mixed materials are common. Small data hard to draw any conclusions.  ",

    "content": "After Burma’s independence, the first set of modern coins was issued (the earliest date struck on the coin is 1949), and the units are 2 Pya, 1Pe, 2Pe, 4Pe and 8Pe in Burmese’s traditional denominations. In 1952, the Burma government changed the currency unit to the decimal Kyat, which were 1P, 5P, 10P, 25P, 50P and 1K. Among them, 4Pe is equivalent to 25P, and 8Pe is equivalent to 50P. At the early of 1952, the last batch of 8Pe (1952) was released. The composition of that 8Pe is different from the previous 1949 and 1950, but it is the same as the 1952 50P released later.\n   Coins 1949 and 1950 8Pe 1952 8Pe 1952-1966 50P     Denominations 8 Pe 8 Pe 50 P   Composition 100% Nickel 75% Copper + 25% Nickel 75% Copper + 25% Nickel    Since the issuance last only one year, it was replaced by the newly released decimal 50P, so the circulated population was small. This let it became a star in the numismatics field and called it “The King of Burmese coins”. In the database, a total of 32 pieces were counted. The source is as follows:\n   Discovery area Discovery quantity     Myanmar 11   China 6   Thailand 7   Other 8    1952 8Pe has proof form, but it was not in a complete set, but appeared as a single piece.

    "content": "In the blog post “1948-1958 first 3 sets difference”, it explains how to distinguish the 3 sets of banknotes, but also explains that the obverse of the second and third sets of banknotes is the same. It’s hard to tell them apart from the front. I also paid a lot of tuition fees for this reason, because the value of the second set of banknotes is much higher than that of the third set of banknotes. It wasn’t until one day when I organized my data and recorded to excel that I realized I might have found a way. I have recorded nearly 400 banknotes of the second set and 1,400 banknotes of the third set, which are arranged in an orderly number distribution. The serial numbers used in the second set seem to be consecutively used by the subsequent third set of banknotes. Now we can tell whether it is the second set or the third set of banknotes just by looking at the serial number on the front of the banknotes.\n   Face value Set 2 Beginning to last serial number found Set 3 Beginning to last serial number found     1 P.38 1A 049903 - 2X 006337 P.42 3D 477359 - 13Q 514588   5 P.39 1A 099903 - 1F 833900 P.43 1G 876378 - 3Q 491015   10 P.40 1A 099935 - 1T 360659 P.44 1V 030420 - 6C 848081   100 P.41 1A 005595 - 1A 789490 P.45 1A 806314 - 1G 287584    Precautions:\n There will be a gap between the end of the second set of banknotes and the beginning of the third set of banknotes, and the information is incomplete. Conclusions are purely subjective guesses.  ",

So who is “the king of Burma paper money”? If I had to choose, I would choose the second set 5 rupee notes—P.39. It is the least top 3 in the prefix number, and it is also the least in the number of notes found on the Internet. The following table shows the information of the first to third sets of banknotes, and each prefix has 6 digits notes.\n   Version Year Denomination SCWPM Number Number of Prefix found Number of notes found     1st set 1948 1R 5R 10R 100R P.34 P.35 P.36 P.37 124 47 50 4 285 143 239 50   2nd set (Rupee) 1952 1R 5R 10R 100R P.38 P.39 P.40 P.41 38 5 18 1 81 21 107 85   3rd set (Kyat) 1952 1K 5K 10K 100K P.42 P.43 P.44 P.45 186 56 89 8 451 204 264 264    Start from the fourth set, each prefix has 7 digits notes. Since there are many prefix and number found on the Internet, and nothing special, so only the graded is counted; except for the sixth set P.60, because many people love and collect, the table shows the real number counted instead of the number of graded. Start from the eighth set, Burma changed its English name to Myanmar. At and after this set, it is no longer the focus of my study. There is only little unimportant data, my blog posts will not discuss it.\n   Version Year Face Value SCWPM Number Number of Graded Found     4th set (with hat) 1958 1K 5K 10K 20K 50K 100K P.46 P.47 P.48 P.49 P.50 P.51 26 13 22 17 32 94   5th set (without hat) 1965 1K 5K 10K 20K P.52 P.53 P.54 P.55 21 21 40 14   6th Set 1972-1979 1K 5K 10K 25K 50K 100K P.56 P.57 P.58 P.59 P.60 P.61 91 66 83 59 1781 52   7th set 1985-1987 15K 35K 45K 75K 90K P.62 P.63 P.64 P.65 P.66 110 17 20 23 30    Precautions:\n The number of grades is the number of graded banknotes found, including PMG, old PCGS, new PCGS, ICG…etc. Grading companies have their own grading population. This blog posts only provide the numbers of graded found on the Internet, the aim is to express the data in another way and act as a reference.    The total number of P.60 found, including those that were graded. ↩︎\n   ",

    "content": "   Front Back          P.60 is one of the sixth set of banknotes after Burma’s independence. Except for the first three sets of banknotes, the amount of P.60 in existence is relatively small. In addition, its banknotes are large in size and exquisite in patterns, which are loved and collected by many people. The sixth set of banknotes was first issued in 1972. The last one issued was not the largest face value 100 kyats P.61, but 50 kyats P.60. The circulation period is the shortest, and the number of prefix found is small, which has become the target of collectors. The information I collected shows that P.60 has 3 prefix, namely DH, DJ, and DK. Among them, DK is the rarest. But in 2017, an eBay friend felw_ipjeth0ql told me there is prefix BX, which surprised me, and I haven’t found another BX prefix until today. So this also indicated that the error in my statistical method is huge. You should consider the risk yourself when reading the blog posts.\n   P.60 prefix Number found     BX 1   DH 121   DJ 43   DK 15       BX prefix         As for whether BX is a replacement, it is beyond my knowledge. In terms of value, a top-tier P.60 (such as PMG66EPQ) can be close to USD2,000, which is much higher than some rare first, second, and third sets of banknotes.\nPrecautions:\n There are quite a few stocks in Myanmar, but most of them are in poor condition.

Most of the articles about Burmese collections I have seen on the Internet over the years are inseparable from the research or discoveries of predecessors. On this basis, some background and historical repackaging are added. It has its merits as a guide article, but for Burmese research future is not much help. Thanks to the Internet, I tried to study Burmese collections in another new way. By using the information that appeared on the Internet, I collected some data, and organized it, presented it in a subjective way, and wrote it into a blog post. There are errors in statistics, don’t be focused to numbers, but understand with generality, which may bring out some useful things. Then it is my honour for the contribution.\n",
