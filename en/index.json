    "content": "After the millennium, I began to collect precious metals. After a period of time, I was involved in Chinese gold and silver coins, coins of the Republic of China, stamps of the Cultural Revolution, Macau coins and Burma coins. After that, I made further research on the collection of Burma and began to collect Burma stamps, tax stamps, stocks, silverware and paintings. I habitually collect information on Burma collections on the internet every day, especially on eBay. I spend at least ten minutes a day, sometimes more than ten hours, for research and sorting. On the other hand, I also pay attention to the auctions of major auction houses; After 20 years of uninterrupted efforts, the self-made Burma database has more than 7,000 in banknotes, more than 2,000 in coins, more than 13,000 banknote photos, and more than 2,000 coin photos.\nSince 2008, I have been operating an online store, making my own website and starting to buy and sell on eBay. I have dealt with previously messy collections and only focused on Burma. After more than ten years of experience, my credit value on eBay is more than 300.\nAfter 2018, physical health sounded an alarm, reducing the intensity of online data collection, and trading has been suspended in 2020. At 2022, I know it may be time to give up. As long as I still have the ability and memory, I redesigned the website and added blog posts to record my subjective views on Burma over the years. Let’s kill time with myself.\nI once wanted to write a book about Burma’s collections. After reading The coins and banknotes of Burma by predecessors M. Robinson and L.A. Shaw repeatedly, the research and production are extremely rigorous, especially in coins. I have no official information, and my understanding of the Burmese language is superficial, making it difficult to write a book. The only thing that is useful in me is the statistics. So the blog posts are based on this aspect, and expresses the real facts of Burma’s collections from the other side.\nComputer failures occurred in 2013 and 2017, and hard drives were damaged. Some data were lost after repairments, but fortunately most of them were retained. Readers in the blog posts should not be too serious, but with a leisurely way.\n",

Its other identity is India’s P.2 (Razack-Jhunjhunwalla 3.3.1) banknote. Prefix of banknote represents different administraion area. At that time, in addition to the Rangoon area, there were Cawnpore, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Lahore and Karachi.

I also paid a lot of tuition fees for this reason, because the value of the second set of banknotes is much higher than that of the third set of banknotes.

The serial numbers used in the second set seem to be consecutively used by the subsequent third set of banknotes.

Except for the first three sets of banknotes, the amount of P.60 in existence is relatively small. In addition, its banknotes are large in size and exquisite in patterns, which are loved and collected by many people. The sixth set of banknotes was first issued in 1972. The last one issued was not the largest face value 100 kyats P.61, but 50 kyats P.60. The circulation period is the shortest, and the number of prefix found is small, which has become the target of collectors. The information I collected shows that P.60 has 3 prefix, namely DH, DJ, and DK. Among them, DK is the rarest. But in 2017, an eBay friend felw_ipjeth0ql told me there is prefix BX, which surprised me, and I haven’t found another BX prefix until today.
