After a period of time, I was involved in Chinese gold and silver coins, coins of the Republic of China, stamps of the Cultural Revolution, Macau coins and Burma coins. After that, I made further research on the collection of Burma and began to collect Burma stamps, tax stamps, stocks, silverware and paintings. I habitually collect information on Burma collections on the internet every day, especially on eBay. I spend at least ten minutes a day, sometimes more than ten hours, for research and sorting. On the other hand, I also pay attention to the auctions of major auction houses; After 20 years of uninterrupted efforts, the self-made Burma database has more than 7,000 in banknotes, more than 2,000 in coins, more than 13,000 banknote photos, and more than 2,000 coin photos.\nSince 2008, I have been operating an online store, making my own website and starting to buy and sell on eBay. I have dealt with previously messy collections and only focused on Burma. After more than ten years of experience, my credit value on eBay is more than 300.\nAfter 2018, physical health sounded an alarm, reducing the intensity of online data collection, and trading has been suspended in 2020. At 2022, I know it may be time to give up. As long as I still have the ability and memory, I redesigned the website and added blog posts to record my subjective views on Burma over the years. Let’s kill time with myself.\nI once wanted to write a book about Burma’s collections. After reading The coins and banknotes of Burma by predecessors M. Robinson and L.A. Shaw repeatedly, the research and production are extremely rigorous, especially in coins. I have no official information, and my understanding of the Burmese language is superficial, making it difficult to write a book. The only thing that is useful in me is the statistics. So the blog posts are based on this aspect, and expresses the real facts of Burma’s collections from the other side.\nComputer failures occurred in 2013 and 2017, and hard drives were damaged. Some data were lost after repairments, but fortunately most of them were retained. Readers in the blog posts should not be too serious, but with a leisurely way.\n",

Its other identity is India’s P.2 (Razack-Jhunjhunwalla 3.3.1) banknote. Prefix of banknote represents different administraion area. At that time, in addition to the Rangoon area, there were Cawnpore, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Lahore and Karachi.

The problem occurred with the S88 serial number. In 2014, I found that the serial number of the P.1b banknote was greater than the S88 200000. I raised a question on this issue in Razack’s blog post. Razack’s answer at that time was based on the Nasik file. I revise the post at later time, my message has missed, and the serial number of P.1b in the blog post has also been changed to S88 200001 to S88 1000000, S89 and S90. However, when I wrote this article, I found that the serial number of some P.1b banknotes in my database was smaller than S88 200001. That is to say, there are P.1b with serial numbers larger and smaller than S88 200000 on the Internet. It seems that the serial number of P.1b needs to be further studied. It is safer to list its serial number as S88-90 for the time being.\nMany counterfeit banknotes of P.1 are fake overprinted on the real Indian P.15b, and it is easy to find out as long as you pay attention to the serial number. The same is true for P.2, adding a fake overprint on the real Indian P.16b.\nPrecautions:\n In the book “The Coins and Banknotes of Burma”, the author mentioned witness the essay of 1000 and 10000 rupees. Whether the 10,000 rupee has notes in circulation is still to be studied. In the article of ‘Indian Paper Money\", it is mentioned that the 100 rupees black overprint has serial number of T41, which is not found in my database for the time of this writing.    6 of them are only ¼ banknotes ↩︎\n   ",

The 11.10b missed two points on the right side of denomination unit, and its silver variety has not been found. In addition, its weight is lighter than that of 11.10a, so it can be believed to be a later struck product of 11.10a.
